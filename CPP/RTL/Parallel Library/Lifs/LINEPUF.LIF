#Life 1.05
#D Line Puffer of width 33
#D 
#D The width is defined by the length of the first free-standing line
#D in the puffer's plume.  The formula for this is 12n+1-s, where n is
#D the number of middle segments, and s is the number of cells covered
#D by the little 3-cell, 5-unit puff-suppressors on the upper edge of
#D this otherwise symmetrical pattern.
#D 
#D Here, n=4, and s=6+5+5.  The Y-shaped puff-suppressors can have 5,
#D 6, or 7 units of spacing on between them, or between one of them and
#D the end.  You only need 2 or 3 such suppressors to produce any
#D puffer width.
#D 
#D Notice that placing random debris behind the puffer sometimes
#D affects the plume permanently - even turning it asymmetrical if the
#D debris was asymmetrical.  It also affects the period of the puffer,
#D that is, the number of generations it takes to repeat.  By
#D increasing the width, the period can be made to rise exponentially,
#D surpassing 10^6 at a width of only about 70.  But the most amazing
#D thing is that it has a half-life on the order of 10^8 generations.
