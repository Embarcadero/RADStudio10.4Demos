#D Puffer train

#D This was created simply by perturbing
#D the sides of a B-heptomino with two
#D LWSS's.  A B-heptomino is a naturally
#D occurring object that lurches forward at
#D the speed c/2 before its own debris
#D usually destroys it.  Not here!  The
#D LWSS keep it alive.  See BHEPTO, RAKE,
#D RAKE2.  For a super dirty puffer, see
#D LINEPUF.
