## Location 

You can find the **CloudExplorer** sample project at:
* **Start | Programs | Embarcadero RAD Studio Rio | Samples** and then navigate to **Object Pascal\Database\CloudAPI\CloudExplorer**.
* **GitHub Repository for Delphi:**[https://github.com/Embarcadero/RADStudio10.4Demos/tree/master/Object%20Pascal/Database/CloudAPI/CloudExplorer/](https://github.com/Embarcadero/RADStudio10.4Demos/tree/master/Object%20Pascal/Database/CloudAPI/CloudExplorer/).

## Description 

The Cloud Explorer application demonstrates how to use the API to: 
*  Connect to accounts.
*  Transfer files between your local machine and the cloud (Amazon S3 and Azure Blob Service).
*  Log the errors and debug the HTTP traffic using a proxy program.

## How to Use the Sample 


1.  Navigate to **Start | Programs | Embarcadero RAD Studio Rio | Samples** and go to **Object Pascal\DataSnap\Cloud\CloudExplorer**.
2.  Open the **CloudExplorer.dproj** project.
3.  Build the **CloudExplorer.dproj** project.
4.  Run the application by clicking **Run > Run** in the IDE or by pressing **F9**.
5.  With the Cloud Explorer application you can:

* **Add Accounts**

*  On the Accounts tab, choose the cloud service type (Azure or Amazon).
*  Enter a unique display name for the new account.
*  For an Amazon account, set the Account name to your Access Key ID, and the Account Key to your Secret Access Key.
*  For an Azure account, set the account name and key.
*  Click the Add button.

* **Connect to an Account**

*  Choose the connection you want to connect to in the Cloud drop-down box.
*  On the Files tab, you will see the list of Containers (for Azure) or Buckets (for Amazon) at the root of the storage account:

*  You can double-click a container or bucket to drill into it and see its contents.
*  The contents are navigated as a virtual directory structure, with slash characters denoting folder names.

*  You can specify a path in the text field above the file list and click Enter to be taken to that location.

* **Transfer Files**

*  You can drag and drop a file from your local machine to the cloud (within a bucket/container).
*  You can right-click a file or directory/bucket/container and choose to upload or download it.
*  Active transfers will be shown on the transfers tab.

* **Log and Proxy**

*  You can enable Info and Error logging on the logging tab.
*  If you want to debug the HTTP traffic, you can check "Use Proxy" on the Log tab, and run a proxy program such as Fiddler.
