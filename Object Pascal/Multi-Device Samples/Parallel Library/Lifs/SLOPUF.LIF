#D SloPuf: Move fast but Puff slowly. A good motto to live your Life by.

#D This can be modified in two ways to give larger periods as follows:
#D 
#D Moving the back 12 spaceships backwards by 9 cells and outwards by 3 cells
#D increases the period by 96.
#D 
#D Moving the back 6 spaceships forwards by one cell and outwards by one cell,
#D and moving the next 6 spaceships forwards by 3 cells and inwards by one cell
#D increases the period by 8 and leaves one more blinker as output.  (This can
#D only be done when there is sufficient room along the center line.)
#D 
#D An interesting linear combination of the two rules results in the following:
#D 
#D Moving the back six spaceships backwards by 6 cells and outwards by 6 cells
#D increases the period by 120 and leaves 3 more blinkers as output.
