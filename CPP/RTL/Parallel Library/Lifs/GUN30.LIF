#Life 1.05
#D p30 glider gun (the Original)
#D
#D This is made of two of a pattern
#D know as the "queen bee", which
#D sometimes occurs naturally,
#D whose debris can be deleted on 
#D the sides by blocks or eaters.
#D But a collision in the center
#D can, as seen here, miraculously 
#D form a glider. Just one of these
#D moving back and forth is called
#D piston (see the p30 in OSCSPN2).
